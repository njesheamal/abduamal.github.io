Before we begin, let’s get the assumptions out of the way. In following this guide, I assume that you have a basic understanding of building a site using HTML, CSS, and JS. I also assume that you have had a confusing experience with Bootstrap and hope to try again. In this guide, I will provide screenshots of my actual process. I did not wake up with this knowledge. In fact, I attribute my success to Ayana Cotton of Flatiron School. Thanks, girl. I will follow a step-by-step format. Did I mention screenshots?

![Step 01.](https://freight.cargo.site/w/2000/q/75/i/5a674c1147e035565e2472bdf626329dc88bc6f7df0c36627109e08cfcada630/sigmund-4UGmm3WRUoQ-unsplash.jpg)
When working on any product, it is important to have a vision. If you are an architect, you make blueprints. [01] If you are a developer, you will make wireframes. These two processes represent the same idea. A wireframe can be done physically, as in pencil to paper, or digitally. I use fluidui.com to make wireframes because of the awesome templates.
![Step 02.](https://freight.cargo.site/w/2000/q/75/i/386409dc314eef8f48e8394a37280d54e3afc762b1eb59ae9908719fbcf3e47e/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-75857-PM.jpg)
[02] After you have your wireframe, it is time to advance to everyone’s favorite part, reading the documentation. I know, you thought we were going to skip over that part. You thought wrong, and here is why. It is important to get a basic understanding of the documentation in order to know which elements are useful to you and which ones aren’t.

For this guide, I will be showing you how to use the BoostrapCDN (more on CDN here). We will be using the BootstrapCDN because it enables us to access bootstrap using only <link> and <script> tags. Easy, yes? Since you read the docs, you know that there are templates that you can use instead of building out your html code out from scratch.
